Following is a review of hello world.

    :::python
    count = 0
    while (count < 101):
        if (count % 5) == 0 and (count % 3) == 0:
            print "FizzBuzz"
            count = count +1
        elif (count % 3) == 0:
            print "Fizz"
            count = count + 1
        elif (count % 5) == 0:
            print "Buzz"
            count = count +1
        else:
            print count
            count = count + 1

Boom, more lines.
